So now I can work on script
$ cdf-create NAME ARGS
which under the hood does
1) docker-machine create NAME ARGS
2) sets up the node NAME
   . www-data user
   . rsync

I guess I'll also need some scripts to
. docker pull on all existing continers inside each node
Hmmm. The whole container upgrade thing being simplified
becomes more important when it has to be done over multiple
nodes!
