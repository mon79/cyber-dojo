Started from Linux Server iso image
http://www.ubuntu.com/download/server

Created new Guest in VirtualBox, called cyber-dojo server, type=Linux, accepted settings
Clicked it to start and it asked for the image
Pointed it to the iso image I downloaded.
Responded to all the questions to setup the server.
Created a user called jon with usual password (sudoer)

Kept network settings as NAT (to enable downloads)   
//need Host-only-adapter for local network.

First fixed keyboard
$ sudo dpkg-reconfigure keyboard-configuration
On 1st step look for Apple option in list but then
*also* look for apple option in subsequent list.


Followed instructions at
https://docs.docker.com/installation/ubuntulinux/

$ wget -qO- https://get.docker.com/ | sh

Recommended adding non root user to docker group as follows
$ sudo usermod -aG docker jon

Is www-data a user?
$ grep www-data /etc/passwd
Yes. So I did this

$ sudo usermod -aG docker www-data

Checking docker install
$ sudo docker run hello-world

Yes it worked.
Now simplest is to setup ssh. I will need to scp the bare repo 
at some point. On git-server
$ cd ~
$ mkdir .ssh
$ chmod 700 .ssh

Copy across credentials to git-server
$ cd ~/.ssh
$ scp id_rsa.pub jon@192.168.59.104:/home/jon/.ssh/authorized_keys

Now I can copy across the build-script
$ cd admin_scripts
$ scp setup_digital_ocean_server.sh jon@192.168.59.104:/home/jon

Now put Network back to NAT and git clone

$ cd var
$ mkdir www
$ cd www
$ git clone https://JonJagger@github.com/JonJagger/cyber-dojo


$ cd /var/www/cyber-dojo
$ cd admin_scripts
$ ./setup_digital_ocean_server.sh

ifconfig says 192.168.59.104
into browser and we have a home page :-)

Create/Setup page fails.
This is because I have not run admin_scripts/pull.sh
No cache.json file languages and exercises
Recreated those manually to check
$ cd languages
$ sudo ./cache.rb
$ sudo chown www-data:www-data cache.json
Same for exercises
Still create page wont load. 
Think it is still rights.
Still need to run pull.sh

Switched back to NAT
ran pull.sh
Trying Bridges-adapter
Didn't seem to work.
Switching back to Host-only-adapter

Looked at log
Problem in LanguagesDisplayNameSplitter.rb
   no conversion from nil to Integer (for  [])
   
I think this is because there are no languages.
Switched back to NAT
$ cd /var/www/cyber-dojo/admin_scripts
$ sudo docker pull cyberdojo/gcc-4.8.1_assert

Switch back to Host-adapter
[create] and yes, I see 
one language [C (gcc)]
one test [assert]

Obviously a missing test somewhere.
If there are no languages installed the create 
setup page should simply show no languages!

Can't create dojo though. 
Think that is because one-self is not connecting.
Still on Host-only adpater. Not good.

And we are up. 


Summary
=======
o) build script should be a single script?
   instead of cloning first perhaps
   wget the script and then run it.
   
o) build script works when building from Ubuntu 14.04.2 server
   as long as you install docker first.
   $ sudo wget -qO- https://get.docker.com/ | sh   
   Perhaps I could add that command anyway.
   Is it a no-op if docker is already installed?   

o) When running on a local laptop with no internet connectivity
   (Host-only-adapter) OneSelf not being visible means you
   can't do local dojos. FIX THIS.
   
o) Add test for LanguagesDisplayNameSplitter when there are no languages.

o) Create new cyber-dojo blog page on setting up a server
   from the 14.04.2 Linux Server image.
