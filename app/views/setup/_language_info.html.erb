The starting files for your chosen language+tests are always
a function called <code>answer</code> that returns <code>6 * 9</code>
and a test called
<code>life, the universe, and everything</code> that expects
<code><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy">42</a></code><br/>
<br/>
The starting files are <em>unrelated</em> to your
chosen exercise. They are simply an example to start you off.<br/>
<br/>
Tests must complete in 15 seconds.<br/>
