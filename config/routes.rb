  # Sample resource route (maps HTTP verbs to controller actions automatically):
  #   resources :products

  #     member do
  #       get 'short'
  #       post 'toggle'
  #     end

  #   resources :products do
  #     resources :comments, :sales

  #     # Directs /admin/products/* to Admin::ProductsController
  #     # (app/controllers/admin/products_controller.rb)
  #     resources :products

  # See how all your routes lay out with "rake routes"

  # This is a legacy wild controller route that's not recommended for RESTful applications.
  # Note: This route will make all actions in every controller accessible via GET requests.
  #match ':controller(/:action(/:id))(.:format)'
